## Our Process
###### This process only covers the execution of a user experience strategy that should be defined by a research process. Nevertheless, the process can work within that strategy to fill the missing pieces, propose improvements and ensure an optimal realisation of the strategy.
- From the first contact to delivering the product, the process is always there. We expect that long after our engagement is over, we have empowered clients with tools to lead user-centered design activities.
- Our process integrates divergent thinking methods to generate more options early on, increasing the odds of success. These ideas are tested and evolved through rapid prototyping.

## Preparation
###### This is the phase where, given the strategic intention of our clients, we'll narrow down the scope of the project and define what needs to happen for them to achieve their goals. This phase assumes that we have an input in the form of research generated insights or other deliverables that were created by following a research process or as the learning outcome of a previous sprint.
- The scope is defined, and user jobs are specified, with a focus on the context rather than specific target groups. Each stage of the design process is divided into activities so that it's easier to estimate the effort required.
- Ideas generated during research, whether it is from user interviews, usage data, analytics, prototypes, design sprints or insights from previous iterations are reviewed and prioritised. The team and client vote on their favorites and job stories are written for the ones that will go into development.


## Ideation
###### Since our aim is on web applications, rather than websites, we aim to produce prototypes that are outcome oriented, we prefer prototypes that contain all the pieces and can be used for tests. We don't believe this part should be ignored and only have the technical feasibility problems pushed down to development and increase the cost of change.
- The ideation phase, depending on the complexity, will produce one or many prototypes.
- By following a tracer bullet approach prioritising a fully working prototype that covers all critical user scenarios. The resulting prototype will aim to address fundamental problems early in the process. The prototype will be used to get early feedback from users and client, and to evaluate the technical feasibility of the ideas with the development team. 
- The principle guiding tracer bullets are completeness and simplicity. We want to see results quickly and have a solution that works. Iterating on a poor solution won't solve the underlying problems that were missed at this stage, it will only increase the cost of change down the road.

## Build and Implement
###### 
- At this point, the project is handed to the development team. This definition phase or pre-project is the base for the development phase. The deliverable of this phase is typically a product requirement document, tested prototypes, and a project plan for development.
The development team should work closely with the designer to ensure that the process remains user-centered.
