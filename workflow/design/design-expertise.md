## Design @ simplabs
Our goal through applying our design expertise is to eliminate the problems that clients face most often when hiring a design service. Our process, knowledge base, team and tools must be optimized around this goal.

### Common client frustrations with design services
- Slow or frustrating design process
- Incorrect Work
- Unclear or inconsistent Process

### The simplabs approach
- We're building web applications, not websites - this is serious software
- Our clients' projects are likely not websites but web applications although they are running in the browser - they might not understand that yet
- We take technology seriously, not as an afterthought (we are no design agency that "can also do the coding"), we're involved with the tools we use
- We choose tools and frameworks because they are sustainable so our clients' projects will be sustainable etc.
- That is all not to say UI/UX is not relevant, but it's not 90% of the project, and then the rest is just making the design "work" somehow
- We do have a process and will involve our clients in that, helping them understand what they want, what they can get in which time and also that we won't be able to guarantee what they can get in which time for what money (prioritization of small steps vs. full planning of complete project)

# Design Thinking
- At simplabs, we believe in applying a sustainable approach to the challenges of our clients. That's why we adopt a design thinking approach to understand the problems facing their businesses.
- We use design thinking to generate breakthrough ideas that can actually be implemented and therefore have an impact.
- We accomplish this by integrating what is desirable from a human point of view with was is technologically feasible.

### What is the context
- Every client is unique, and so they face unique challenges. For this reason, we cannot rely on applying the same tools and methods for each. Our approach to problem-solving is customized, flexible and scalable.
- Providing value to customers becomes vital to any organization to sustain their business in the future. 

### What could go wrong
- Not understanding the problems can be expensive, time-consuming and risky. Especially for startups.

### What we do instead
- We use tools and methods to deliver solutions that match people's needs
- We help our clients to hone and refine with their existing knowledge stage and generate the leap from stage to stage, continuously, in a process
- We create sustainable advantage

### What is the outcome
- Meaningful changes that add to customer value
- A business tool to ensure continuous value generation and increased market opportunity

### Deliverables
- Design-led meetings
- Mini-Sprints
- Research
- Lead user workshops

### Why us
- Our process is designed to break the siloed-practices that hinder innovation by enabling a shared understanding of the problems
- We use a design-led approach to meetings
- Our process results in the shortening of development cycles
- We build products that launch

# User Experience Design
- At simplabs, we value solutions that are not only centered on technology, but also on the humans that will use them
- Our solutions are created to work across a customer's lifetime, by understanding the users experience at every touchpoint

### What is the context
- Technology can make a product robust, but it cannot ensure customers will enjoy it
- Design is a strong competitive factor with more products competing by design â€”regardless of business size, industry

### What could go wrong
-  A bad experience can break any product and prevent its growth
- Shallow understanding  of users can lead to a poor experience
- Centering only on technology is less sustainable, harder to scale

### What we do instead
- We conceptualize after diving deep into the user experience 
- We design effective solutions driven by business goals and customer perceptions
- We develop more insightful design solutions by aligning business goals and audience needs
- We always apply a rationale for design decisions
- We make a product more straightforward to implement
- Design for ease of adoption, not just functionality 

### What's the outcome
- Competitive advantage for the client
- Actionable results 
- Reduce manage churn
- Drive increased value for existing customers
- Improved customer experience and satisfaction

### Why us
- Style as strategy: We can translate business, competitive and audience needs into a visual design strategy
- Design as a way to make product improvements in features
- Broad, multi-dimensional approach to design, that focuses on product performance, as opposed to a styling function
