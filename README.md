# simplabs Playbook

Our playbook describes how we work. The contents are maintained in Markdown
files in the [src](./src) folder. The playbook can also be compiled to a PDF:

```bash
yarn prepare-book # compiles the playbook into one big HTML file at dist/book.html
yarn compile-book # converts dist/book.html into a PDF at dist/book.pdf
```
